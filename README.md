# Tic-Tac-Toe-wth-AI
 A Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python With AI

# Playing
Currently we have no proper frontends implemented. I will do in near future.
For now you may
 - Create/Activate the virtual environement (recommended)
 - (There are no deps)
 - install the library as an editable package
 	`python -m pip install --editable library/`
 - `cd frontends`

 Now, run
 `python -m console`
 to play against the minimax AI which can never be defeated
 
 available args are
  - `-X` to set X player (one of `human`, `random`, `minimax`)
  - `-O` to set O player (one of `human`, `random`, `minimax`)
  - `--starting` to set starting player (either `X` or `O`)
